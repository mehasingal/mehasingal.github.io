Sea otters (*Enhydra lutris*) are marine mammals found along the North Pacific coasts, known for their **dense fur**, the thickest of any animal, which keeps them warm in cold waters. As a *keystone species*, they help maintain **kelp forest ecosystems** by controlling sea urchin populations. Sea otters are *highly intelligent*, often using tools like rocks to crack open shellfish. Once hunted nearly to extinction for their fur, conservation efforts have helped them recover, though they still face threats like **oil spills** and **fishing gear entanglement**. These playful animals are a symbol of *marine biodiversity* and ecosystem health.


## Habitat

Sea otters inhabit coastal marine environments in the North Pacific Ocean, including areas off the coasts of California, Alaska, Russia, and Japan. They prefer shallow waters near kelp forests, seagrass beds, and rocky shorelines, which provide abundant food and shelter. These habitats are rich in marine invertebrates like sea urchins, crabs, clams, and mussels, which make up the sea otters' diet. Kelp forests also serve as a safe resting area, where sea otters can anchor themselves using kelp fronds to avoid drifting. While primarily coastal, sea otters occasionally venture further offshore, especially in areas with calm waters. Their reliance on specific habitats makes them vulnerable to environmental changes, pollution, and habitat destruction.
