# All About Sea Otters

Sea otters (*Enhydra lutris*) are marine mammals found along the North Pacific coasts, known for their **dense fur**, the thickest of any animal, which keeps them warm in cold waters. As a *keystone species*, they help maintain **kelp forest ecosystems** by controlling sea urchin populations. Sea otters are *highly intelligent*, often using tools like rocks to crack open shellfish. Once hunted nearly to extinction for their fur, conservation efforts have helped them recover, though they still face threats like **oil spills** and **fishing gear entanglement**. These playful animals are a symbol of *marine biodiversity* and ecosystem health.


## Habitat

Sea otters inhabit coastal marine environments in the North Pacific Ocean, including areas off the coasts of California, Alaska, Russia, and Japan. They prefer shallow waters near kelp forests, seagrass beds, and rocky shorelines, which provide abundant food and shelter. These habitats are rich in marine invertebrates like sea urchins, crabs, clams, and mussels, which make up the sea otters' diet. Kelp forests also serve as a safe resting area, where sea otters can anchor themselves using kelp fronds to avoid drifting. While primarily coastal, sea otters occasionally venture further offshore, especially in areas with calm waters. Their reliance on specific habitats makes them vulnerable to environmental changes, pollution, and habitat destruction.

### Tool Use and Foraging
Sea otters are well known for their intelligence, particularly their ability to use tools. They use rocks to break open the shells of clams, mussels, and sea urchins, making them one of the few tool-using marine mammals. Their diet consists primarily of marine invertebrates, and they eat up to 25% of their body weight daily to sustain their high metabolic rates. This behavior reflects their adaptability and resourcefulness in obtaining food.

### Social Dynamics
Sea otters exhibit complex social behavior, often forming groups called rafts. These rafts, which can consist of a few individuals or up to hundreds, are typically segregated by sex, with males and females forming separate groups. Males are territorial, especially in areas rich in food resources. Despite being social, otters spend significant time grooming themselves individually, a vital activity for maintaining the insulating properties of their dense fur.


## Threats and Conservation

Sea otters have faced significant threats throughout history, particularly from the fur trade, which nearly drove them to extinction. Although their populations have rebounded in some areas due to conservation efforts, they remain vulnerable to modern challenges. Oil spills are especially devastating, as the oil damages their fur’s insulating properties, leading to hypothermia. Entanglement in fishing gear, habitat destruction, and climate change also pose risks. Continued conservation efforts, habitat protection, and pollution prevention are essential to safeguarding these vital marine mammals.
